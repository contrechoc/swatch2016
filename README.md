feel free to do whatever your want with the script

on three analog pins of the ATTINY are textile resistive yarn patches
the  minimum and maximum values are calibrated automatically during the first seconds
during the calibration you have to press the patches
then the values are mapped to the RGB Neopixel

example of mapping 3D data to a RGB LED - datavisualisation
